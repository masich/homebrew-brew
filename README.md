Homebrew Tap containing my macOS applications. 

Available Casks
SaveMyEyes. Minimalistic macOS application that helps to take breaks while using the computer

Installation
Don’t have Brew? Follow these instructions.
Add this Tap:
`brew tap masich/brew`
Install a Cask:
`brew install --cask savemyeyes`

## Updating
Brew users do update by periodically running:
```shell
brew update
```

If Brew indicates there’s a new version of one of the casks, for example, `savemyeyes`:
```shell
brew cask upgrade savemyeyes
```
